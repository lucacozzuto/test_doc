Some more examples:

Code highlighted in python

.. code-block:: python

	# This program prints Hello, world!

	print('Hello, world!')
	weekdays = ["Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday","Wednesday", "Thursday","Friday", "Saturday"]
	print("The Weekdays are:\n")

	for day in range(len(weekdays)):
    		print(weekdays[day])
